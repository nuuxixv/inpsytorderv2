feat: Implement event-specific order management

- Integrate URL query parameter 'events' to identify specific events for orders.
- Modify OrderPage.jsx to fetch event details (id, discount_rate) based on the 'events' slug.
- Implement an event selection dialog in OrderPage.jsx when no valid event slug is provided.
- Update CostSummary.jsx to dynamically apply discount rates based on the selected event.
- Ensure event_id is saved with order data in the 'orders' table.
